		<h2>Student Support Package</h2>
		<p>MMU has created a <strong>£1,000 per year financial package for full-time students</strong>. The package is available for any UK full-time students up to and including £25,000 household income. The goal of this package is to help students financially during their studies. The full amount will be paid on METCARD. The students can use it to purchase their accommodation fees at MMU Halls of residence, buy equipment’s, or purchase their meal at the University. You do not need to apply separately for the Student Support Package, just make sure that you ticked the ‘share information with institution’ box when you apply for Student Finance.</p>

		<h2>Tuition Fees</h2>
		<p>UK and EU full-time student fees: £9,000. Non-EU full-time international student fees: £11,650. UK and EU part-time student fees: £2250 per 30 credits No matter what the fees are for your chosen course, it is important to remember that you will not pay anything up front for your tuition if you take out a Tuition Fee Loan to cover the cost of your education: you will only start to begin repaying the loan after graduation once you are earning over £21,000. You can check how much you will have to repay on the Student Finance Website. (https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan) You apply for this support through the central loans company for your country no matter which university you choose to study at, so for example, an English student will apply through Student Finance England. <strong>Remember:</strong> you need to apply for your tuition fee loan every year of your course.</p>

		<h2>Maintenance Grant and Loan</h2>
		<p>Full-time students can also apply for a Student Maintenance Loan (up to £6,535 repayable) and Maintenance grant (up to £3,354 non-repayable) - which are both means-tested. You may also be eligible for additional support if you have dependents e.g. Childcare grant, Parents’ Learning Allowance or Adult Dependants’ Grant You can find information about student finance on the Student Finance England website(https://www.gov.uk/student-finance) or ring their helpline for advice: 0845 300 50 90.</p>

		<h2>Working as a student</h2>
		<p>Many students work part time while they study to earn some extra money to support themselves. You can find casual work advertised through our <strong>jobs4students scheme</strong>, and also through the jobshop at the <strong>Students’ Union.</strong></p>

		<h2>NUS Extra Card</h2>
		<p>The NUS Extra card offers great discounts online and in store with over 160 retailers. It costs only £12 for a year The discounts are generally about 10-20% (some are as high as 50%), and include Asos, McDonalds, Odeon, Amazon, 16-25 Railcard, Superdrug and many more. To get an NUS Extra card, apply online on the NUS website (http://www.nus.org.uk/en/nusextra/). Check the full list of NUS Extra discounts (http://www.nus.org.uk/en/nusextra/discounts/) first to make sure you'll use it, and check individual offer terms before you go.</p>

		<h2>Making a Budget</h2>
		<p>This is where you match up money coming in with what's going out. It's incredibly important, or you may have a great first week splashing the cash, but spend the rest of term struggling to survive. Knowing how much income you'll have is essential. Most will come from maintenance loans, grants, any bursaries or scholarships, part-time work pay and parents' contributions. But no matter where the money comes from, the golden rule is to NEVER spend more than your income. Of course, right now it's tough to work out exactly what you'll spend on books, transport, course equipment and partying.</p>

		<h2>Sports Bursary</h2>
		<p>MMU awards a number of athletes every year who demonstrate aspirations to achieve high levels of success within their chosen sport. There are 3 different packages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Gold</strong></p></li>
			<li><p>Financial contribution</p></li>
			<li><p>Bespoke strength and conditioning training sessions with a professional coach</p></li>
