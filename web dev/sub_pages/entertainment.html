		<h2>New Student Union</h2>
		<p>The university has recently invested £10m into building a new Student Union, which opened in September 2014. The new Union contains a shop, bar and nightclub with student friendly prices as well as including a number of social, cultural and sporting activities.</p>

		<h2>Health and Fitness</h2>
		<p>Those interesting in health, fitness and sports have a number of facilities around the University campus. </p>
		<p>The <strong>Aquatics Center</strong> has a gym, 50m swimming pool, diving pool and health suite. All of these facilities are available through a studentdiscounted membership.</p>
		<p><strong>Sugden Sports Centre</strong> also offers a student membership, which would grant access to a gym, sports hall, 3G pitches and more.</p>

		<h2>Shopping</h2>
		<p>Manchester is well known nationwide for shopping. As well as the Northern Quarter, there is the <strong>Arndale Center</strong> in the city center with a diverse range of store, most of which offer student discount. The <strong>Trafford Centre</strong> is much further away and would require transport. However there is much more to do once there; facilities for food, drink and other forms of entertainment are readily available. </p>
		<img src="../images/shopping.jpg" alt="Arndale Centre" style="float:right;">
		<h2>Educational</h2>
		<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive day out, you can save your money whilst learning when visiting one of Manchester’s many free museums. Here are just a few museums with free entry (Donations welcome):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Industry and Science</strong></p>
				<p>Creative exploration of how science, innovation and industry created and sustain modern society.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Manchester Museum </strong></p>
				<p>Dinosaurs, mummies and live animals including loads of other great stuff from the natural world and different cultures. </p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>National Football </strong></p>
				<p>The world’s greatest football collection - over 140,000 items - including the FIFA Collection.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Manchester Art Gallery</strong></p>
				<p>Manchester Art Gallery is one of the country’s finest art museum.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The <strong>Wheel of Manchester</strong> is located in Piccadilly Gardens. The 60 meter high wheel will cost around £9.00 for general admission but the experience allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the stunning views above Manchester.
		</p>

		<p>The <strong>Northern Quarter</strong> is a vibrant and cultural area that begins just a minute’s walk from Piccadilly Gardens. There are numerous bars, cafes, restaurants and shops make the Northern Quarter a great place to visit day or night.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Printworks</strong> is also located in the city center. There are bars, restaurants and a cinema, which together offer a wide range of entertainment options from seeing the latest film to watching a live music performance. The Printworks now host their own fresher’s fair at the beginning of the academic year where students can register for a Student Card, which offers promotions and discounts throughout The Printworks.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Chill Factor</strong>is an indoor ski slope located next to the Trafford Centre, therefore if you are without transport the easiest option is to get a bus to the Trafford Centre. There is a student discount available for any of the snow sport activities which makes it much more attractive and affordable.</p>
