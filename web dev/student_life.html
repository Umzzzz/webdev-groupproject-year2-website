		<p>The time you spend at university will be some of the most entertaining and enjoyable years of your life. The way social media is used allows students to easily meet and communicate. There are groups for new students and halls, existing students, societies and more.</p>


		<p>Manchester is a large city with a student population of over 37,000 at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) alone. Despite the size of the city it is very easy to navigate on foot or using public transport, the city center is very close to the MMU Campus.</p>

		<h2>Student Benefits</h2>
		<p>There are a number of benefits you become eligible for as a student including discounts in shops, restaurants and some online retailers. Being a student is notoriously difficult financially, especially when not managing finances properly. However, there is financial benefits of being a student like interest free overdrafts and tax-free earnings!</p>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h2>Student Offers</h2>
		<p>University offers many opportunities including travel. There are a number of Study Abroad schemes offering the chance to spend time at European and international Universities. It appears to have become a very common debate; to study or to travel. Well, university is provides the perfect opportunity to combine the two.</p>


		<h2>Student Access</h2>
		<p>Being a student enables access to a libraries of information that contain nearly every thing you will ever need for your studies and personal interests. Not only are there resources available in the library, most university buildings provide equipment and services for all your education needs. An example of the equipment available is MMUs Multimedia Resource Library, which has a suite of iMac computers with software to work on media, which can be gathered using professional photography equipment.</p>

		<p>Manchester has a number of locations where students temporarily reside. First year students often find accommodation close to campus. Being close to campus is great with almost everything you need within walking distance, which allows you to explore and discover the area.</p>

		<p>Moving further away from campus, 2nd and 3rd year students tend to find alternative places to live like Victoria Park or Fallow field. Victoria Park is a student area close to Curry Mile, which is a mile long strip of takeaways and restaurants. Fallow field can be appealing to most students leaving first year for cheaper halls and housing. The area has a huge Sainsburyâ€™s with a lot of bars and fast food restaurants.</p>
