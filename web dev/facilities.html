		<h2>Multimedia Resource Library</h2>
		<p>In Manchester Metropolitan University, we have several facilities for our students to use for their assessments which they have to do part of their degree. The information and communication department has amazing space within Geoffrey Manton (GM) building called the Multimedia Resource Library (MRL). In the MRL we have Apple Macs and PCs with the latest software’s, from your daily tasks using Microsoft office, to your Creative package, Adobe Creative Suite. These facilities are only exclusive to Information and Communication students. We create this space for our students, so that they can do their projects while socializing and getting to know other students from other years.</p>

		<h2>Visual Production Kits</h2>
		<p>Also we have full visual production kits which include video cameras, DLSR Cameras and sound kits. Our camera kits are top of the range from Sony to Cannon. The students can loan these out when they are doing their creative assessments on their course. Other facilities we have a radio booth where students can book appointments and record great quality voice overs for their videoproduction piece. The MRL is open at normal hours from 9am-5pm.</p>

		<p>If the MRL facilities are not enough for you, we have various IT suites across the campus. Level 1 in Geoffrey Manton building has a full IT Suite with PCs and Macs to use, which is open from 9am-8pm. Our 75 million pounds Business School building has various IT suites, with latest hardware and software to use, those suites are open till 9am-10pm.</p>

		<h2>Library</h2>
		<p>24 hour library for students who wish to borrow books, eBooks and journals can do so by their Student ID. Depending on the book labels inside the cover, if it’s red then you are only allowed to have the book for 1 week and if its white label, then you can have the book for whole month. There is online system for our students to browse all our books and they can get them reserved. Also they can access online eBooks and journals within the library online system. Students can even loan out laptops from the library to take home and use.</p>

		<p>The library itself have five levels, full of books and IT suites for Manchester Metropolitan University students, they have dedicated study areas, depending on your preferences whether you want to work in peace or work as group.</p>


		<h2>Digitial Innovation Shed</h2>
		<p>This year we have introduced something new called the Digital Innovation aka ‘The Shed.’ We are creating space for our students to collaborate with various students from other degrees to collaborate together on projects and make space for the new market in the Industry. Whether you come from English, Computing, Computer science and many more, you all have background of digital. Digital is not just in web world, it has vastly grown in different aspects throughout various sectors. Also in the shed we host events, where well known speakers and industry people come in to talk to our students. We get our students to mix in with the industry people, so it’s easier for them to get to know what is out there for them in the real world.</p>

		<p>Finally all these facilities have printers from colour to black and white. We also have scanners as well. Throughout the whole University Campus we have Wi-Fi access which is a bonus! For those students who want to save their internet data.
