# Website Development Year 2 Group Project

In this project I worked as group to create website for my course department which is Journalism, Information and Communications
Departmennt.As a group we had to think creative and be creative, by coming up with our own engaging content, layout and styling
of the website. We have used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create this website. Finally,  we have used flex box for our 
grid layout on the home page. My roles in this project were also to deal with documentations, content writing 
and photography for the website.
